			<!-- Electricity  -->
			<h3 id="e">
				Electricity
			</h3>
			<h4 id="e1">
				How is electricity measured?
			</h4>
			The main way to measure electricity is the watt-hour. The watt (W) is a measure
			of electrical power. From light bulbs to different appliances are marked with a
			watt rating to give an indication of the amount of electrical power they need to
			work.
			<a href="#m" class="top">top ^</a>
			<h4 id="e2">
				What is electricity consumption?
			</h4>
			Electricity consumption is a combination of the amount of electricity (that is,
			the watt) and the period of time for which it’s used. So a standard measure of electricity
			consumption is the amount of watts used over an hour: the watt-hour (Wh).
			<br />
			<br />
			An electricity bill records the number of kilowatt-hours (kWh) consumed over a period.
			<a href="#m" class="top">top ^</a>
			<h4 id="e3">
				How should electricity data be recorded in the platform?
			</h4>
			We recommend to record electricity readings taken from physical meters. A physical
			meter reading offers you consumption data taken at hourly intervals that could help
			you to see patterns of your electricity use and find ways to conserve electricity.
			Your bill, on the other hand, is based on your actual electricity use at the end
			of each billing period or on your electricity usage patterns in the past. <a href="#m"
				class="top">top ^</a>
			<h4 id="e4">
				How CSI Web App calculate electricity source emissions?
			</h4>
			CSI Web App uses recorded data on electricity consumption (kWh) and DEFRA´s conversion
			factor to calculate electricity emissions. <a href="#m" class="top">top ^</a>
			<!-- Fuels  -->
			<h3 id="f">
				Fuels
			</h3>
			<h4 id="f1">
				Which fuels are included in CSI Web App?
			</h4>
			Our CSI tool cover the most common fuels used in the construction industry site activities. 
            The main fuels types are CNG, LPG, Burning Oil, Diesel (average biofuel blend) – Supplied 
            by petrol stations around the UK, Diesel(100% mineral diesel) - Wholesale buy, gas oil and 
            petrol (average biofuel blend and 100% mineral petrol).<br />
			<br />
            The tool can also measure the emission arising from the use of natural gas however, at the 
            moment, the tool is only able to measure it by volume. Either cubic meters or Litres.<br />
			<br />
            Nonetheless we are in the process to updated the tool and create a new meter option to deal 
            exclusively with gas consumption. The tool will convert the volume of gas used to kWh using 
            an appropriated calorific value and convert it to carbon emissions equivalent using the correct 
            emissions factor. 
            <a href="#m" class="top">top ^</a>
            <h4 id="f2">
				How should fuel data be recorded in the platform?
			</h4>
			The best way to record fuel consumption is to use fuel purchase receipts showing the volume 
            of fuel purchased. If you would like to input values extracted from the gas bill, for example, 
            we recommend you to use the actual meter reading in metric units and not the value in kWh.   
            If in doubt please get in touch with us using <a href="mailto:support@siteimpacts.com">
            support@siteimpacts.com</a> and we will be happy to help.<br />
			<br />
            <strong>Warning</strong> CSI Web App can only record natural gas in metric volume 
            units (litre or cubic meters).<br />
			<br />
            Suppliers measure the gas units you use in either in cubic feet (ft3) or in cubic 
            meters (m3)  but this is converted in kWh using he fuel calorific value as one 
            unit of gas does not always produce exactly the same amount of electricity.<br />
            <br />                     
            You can find gas units in your gas bills to record gas usage but remember you 
            can record metric volume units.<br />
			<br />
            <strong>DISCLOSURE NOTE:</strong> The CO2 emissions results from the selection of a kWh 
            conversion factor on a gross calorific value (CV) basis can be higher or lower than the 
            CO2 emissions results from CSI Web App depending on the calorific value of the gas used.

				class="top">top ^</a>
			<h4 id="f3">
				Can I use fuel meters for transport?
			</h4>
			Yes, if your company has fuel cards you should use a fuel meter to record the emissions
            (preferred by DEFRA). <a href="#m" class="top">top ^</a>
            <h4 id="f4">

				Transport
			</h3>
			<h4 id="t1">
				How should commercial transport data be recorded in the platform?
			</h4>
			You can select and record the type of transport and the kilometers/miles travelled
			for each delivery. If you mark “round trip” box the platform will calculate a figure 
            of total distance travelled. <br />
			<br />
			OUR ROADMAP: We are working on a functionality to record a multiple delivery route
			to include the distance travelled to the site (from the previous delivery) plus
			the distance to the next delivery or return. <a href="#m" class="top">top ^</a>
            <h4 id="t2">
				How many way are to measure commercial transport?
			</h4>
			There are two ways to measure commercial transport available: Distance feature and Location feature.
			<br />
			<br />
			<strong>Distance feature</strong> 
			<br />
            <br />
			Distance feature should be used if you know the distance travelled.
            <br />
            <br />
			<strong>Location feature</strong> 
			<br />
            <br />
			Location feature works with Google Maps and should be used if you do not know the distance but know the address
            from the point of origin as long as it is delivered by road.
			<br />
			<br />
			<strong>DISCLOSURE NOTE:</strong> All Google Map distances must be taken as estimations so SiteImpacts
            does not accept any responsibility that may arise for any inaccuracy from it use. <a href="#m" class="top">top ^</a>
            <h4 id="t3">
				How CSI Web App calculate transport source emissions?
			</h4>
			CSI Web App uses recorded data on distance travelled and DEFRA´s conversion factor
			for most common transport types to calculate transport source emissions.
            <br />
			<br />It must be consider that, to convert distance travelled to CO2e, an uplift 
            of 15% is applied, acording to considered best practice, to account for real world 
            driving conditions.<a href="#m"

			measured in tonnes (1 tonne = 1000 kg). <a href="#m" class="top">top ^</a>
			<h4 id="w2">
				How CSI Web App calculate waste source emissions?
			</h4>
			CSI Web App uses recorded data on waste generation and DEFRA´s conversion factor
			for landfill (‘gate to grave’) to calculate waste source emissions. It must be consider
			that we have not identified suitable carbon factor options for many waste types.
			<br />
			<br />
			OUR ROADMAP: We are working on functionalities to record waste generation according
			to the source activity (Construction Waste, Demolition Waste and Excavation Waste)
			and waste destination. It will include WRAP standardised volume to mass conversion

        Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely
        secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee
        the security of your data transmitted to our web application; any transmission is at your

        WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?
        <br />
        <br />
        We use the information we hold about you in the below manner:
        <br />
        <br />
        To ensure that content from our web application is presented in the most effective manner
        for you and for your computer.<br />
        To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or
        which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such
        purposes of course.<br />
        To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you
        and us.<br />
        To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose
        to do so.<br />
        To notify you about changes to our service.<br />
        We may also use your data, or permit selected third parties to use your data, to
        provide you with information about goods and services which may be of interest to
        you and we or they may contact you about these by post or telephone.<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail
        or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the
        subject of a previous sale to you.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are a new registered user, and where we permit selected third parties to
        use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you have
        consented to this. If you do not want us to use your data in this way, or to pass
        your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, please tick the relevant
        box situated on the form on which we collect your data (the registration form).
        <br />
        <br />
        We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers,
        but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example,
        we may inform them about the general user profiles that have clicked on their ads
        (e.g. site type and size (occupants), but we will never disclose details of an individual
        site or user names). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from
        you to enable us to comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement
        to that target audience.
        <br />
        <br />
        WE ANONYMISE THE DATA YOU PROVIDE US AND AGGREGATE IT WITH OTHER DATA TO IMPROVE
        THE SERVICES WE MAKE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEB APPLICATION
        <br />
        <br />
        The purpose of our web application is to assist you in operating your business or organisation
        in a more environmentally efficient way and to save costs related to resource consumption.
        You provide us with data about the buildings (sites) and facilities you operate.
        In addition, you log data concerning your consumption of resources including but
        not limited to electricity, gas, water, waste etc. We benchmark you against other
        users operating similar sites to yours, as well as against external benchmarks that
        have been established by third party organisations such as CIBSE in the UK (no individual
        consumption data from the SiteImpacts platform will be made available to those organisations).
        We then provide you with a high level assessment of the savings potential and possibly
        with recommendations for how to reduce your consumption.
        <br />
        <br />
        To achieve our purpose we anonymise the consumption data provided by all our registered
        users and use it - typically in an aggregated form - to provide a benchmark for
        the respective site type, and possibly other criteria such as country. Any consumption
        benchmark graphs we display are based on aggregated data from data inputted by our
        registered users over time. We use fully automated methods to generate the benchmarks
        and create these graphs.
        <br />
        <br />
        For our database we also use the data you submit when you set up savings projects
        (i.e. essentially resource efficiency measures you implement for your web application).
        Users can search this database to find examples of potentially suitable savings
        projects for their sites. The data is always anonymised before it is made available
        to users. For instance, a user can search for savings projects using specific filters
        like site type (e.g., office), country (e.g., UK), consumption category (e.g. electricity)
        and payback (e.g. less than 3 years). The results from the search will contain key
        project performance data such as project cost, savings and payback but they will
        exclude any data that can be linked back to individual users or sites, including
        site names, project names, underlying consumption figures etc. We use automated
        methods to anonymise and analyse the project performance data.
        <br />
        <br />
        The way we operate our web application ensures that all registered users get to benefit
        from the collective knowledge and best practices built up through the SiteImpacts
        platform, however information which can be linked to a specific user or site will
        never be shared with other registered users.
        <br />
        <br />
        WE MAY DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION IN THIS WAY
        <br />
        <br />
        We value your privacy but we may have to disclose your personal information to third
        parties:
        <br />
        <br />
        In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose
        your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.<br />
        If SiteImpacts or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party,
        in which case personal data held by it about its registered users will be one of
        the transferred assets.<br />
        If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply
        with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our general terms of
        use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of SiteImpacts,
        our registered users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other
        companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk
        reduction.<br />

        You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by ticking certain boxes
        on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any
        time by contacting us at info@SiteImpacts.com.<br />
